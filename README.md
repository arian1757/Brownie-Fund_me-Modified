**Fund Me Smart Contract**

The Fund Me smart contract is a modified version of the original contract with additional features to enhance the functionality and user experience.

**Features**

1. **Supporter Reason**: Supporters can now choose the reason for their donation to the contract owner. They have the option to specify reasons such as education or podcasts. However, supporters can also donate without declaring a specific reason.
1. **Supporter Ranking**: Supporters can check their rank among other supporters based on the amount of value they have sent to the contract. This ranking feature allows supporters to see their contribution level compared to others.
1. **Emergency Funding**: The contract owner has the ability to initiate an emergency funding campaign. The owner can specify the reason for the emergency funding and the amount of money required, such as purchasing a camera for $1000. This feature enables the owner to request immediate financial support for urgent needs.
1. **Emergency Fund Donation**: Supporters can select the emergency fund function and contribute money specifically for the emergency funding cause. This allows supporters to directly contribute to emergency situations and help address urgent needs.
1. **Transparent Funding Categories**: The contract provides transparency by displaying the amount of money allocated to different categories. Users can easily see how much money has been allocated to categories such as education, podcasts, emergency funding, and others. This ensures transparency and accountability in the allocation of funds.

**User Interface**

The fund\_me-front folder contains a basic front-end design for interacting with the smart contract. This user interface allows users to access the various features of the contract, including connecting to the contract, checking balance, making withdrawals, funding purposes, viewing rankings, initiating emergency funding, and accessing funding details.
